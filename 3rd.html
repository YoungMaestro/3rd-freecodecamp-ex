        <header>The mother board</header>
        <p>The motherboard is the skeleton of the system, it conects everything together and it controls the flow of electrisity of each part. Be carefull as mother boards could have some incompatibilities depending in which kind of GPU, CPU, Ram speed can the mother board support</p>
          <p>The characteristics of a mother board may look like this:</p>
          <code><ul>
            <li>Supports X gen prossesors</li>
            <li>Supports Xgb of RAM</li>
            <li>Supports display port / HDMI</li>
        </ul></code></section>
      <section class="main-section" id="the_CPU">
        <header>The CPU</header>
        <p>The CPU is the brain of the system, it makes millions of small calculations per second and its speed it's calculated in Ghz. It can also have different characteristics that make it more powerfull/better, such as, more threats or more cores (that help in multitasking)</p>
        <p>The characteristics of a CPU may look like this:</p>
        <code><ul>
            <li>X.Xghz</li>
            <li>X cores</li>
            <li>X threats</li>
        </ul></code></section>
      <section class="main-section" id="the_brick">
        <header>The brick</header>
        <p>The brick, or better called, the power suply is as simple as it could get, it is where you connect the pc to the grid, they have different certifications depending in their quality and power input, a word of advice, avoid those that don't have at least Bronce certification as they tend to breack and fail a lot more often</p>
        <p>The characteristics of a brick may look like this:</p>
        <code><ul>
            <li>From bronce to platinum certification</li>
            <li>X Wats</li>
        </ul></code></section>
      <section class="main-section" id="the_GPU">
        <header>The GPU</header>
        <p>The GPU, abreviated for Graphical Prosecing Unit, loads everything related to graphics. For example: images, videos, 3d models, etc.</p>
        <p>The characteristics of a GPU may look like this:</p>
        <code><ul>
          <li>X Gbt</li>
          <li>X cores</li>
          <li>X slot</li>
        </ul></code></section>
      <section class="main-section" id="the_disk">
        <header>The disk</header>
        <p>The disk is the part that stores all information.There are different types, the most common are, the HDD(Cheap, reliable but slow) and the SSD (fast but more expensive and with less space)</p>
        <p>The characteristics of a disk may look like this:</p>
        <code><ul>
          <li>X Gbt / Tb</li>
          <li>X Mb / S</li>
        </ul></code></section>
